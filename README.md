# Parallel Processing
Data parallel approach for various distributed  algorithms
1. DATA PARALLEL APPROACH using DISTRIBUTED NON-SHARED MEMORY for SIEVE of Erastosthenes.
 PARALLELIZATION SCHEME (Calculating the time and number of prime numbers generated,Generating all the prime numbers )
 2.Parallel program using MPI to compute π using Simpson’s Rule(BLOCKING SEND,NON BLOCKING SEND)
 3.MPI program(PING PONG METHOD,HOT POTATO )method
